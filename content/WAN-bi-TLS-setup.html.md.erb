title: Set Up a Bidirectional System
---

This section describes how to set up a bidirectional WAN connection, using TLS encryption,
between two <%=vars.product_full%> service instances in two different foundations. 
A bidirectional connection like this is needed if you wish to implement an active-active pattern, as described in
[Bidirectional Replication Across a WAN](design-patterns.html#active-active-WAN-pattern).

##<a id="wan-bi-tls-assumptions"></a> Assumptions

- You have two <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> (<%=vars.app_runtime_abbr%>) foundations, A and B, with a network connection between them.
- You wish to establish a TLS-encrypted WAN connection between a service instance on Foundation A and a service instance on Foundation B.
- The connection will be bidirectional, such that operations in each cluster can be replicated in the other.
- The [Preparing for TLS](prepare-TLS.html) procedure has been followed for each foundation, establishing a CredHub “/services/tls_ca” certificate for each.
- The [Establishing Mutually Trusted TLS Credentials](WAN-mutual-credentials.html) procedure has been followed, establishing mutually trusted TLS credentials between Foundations A and B.

## <a id="wan-create-clusters"></a>Create Clusters

1. Log into Foundation A using Foundation A Cloud Foundry credentials.

1. Use the `cf create-service` command to create a service instance, which we will call Cluster A in this example.
In the `cf create-service` command, use the `-c` option with the argument `"tls" : true` to enable TLS.
This example also uses the `-c` option to set the `distributed_system_id` of Cluster A to "1":

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf create-service p-cloudcache wan-cluster wan1 -c '{
    "tls" : true,
    "distributed_system_id" : 1 }'
    </pre>

    Verify the completion of service creation prior to continuing
    to the next step.
    Output from the `cf services` command will show the `last operation` as
    `create succeeded` when service creation is completed.

1. Log into Foundation B using Foundation B Cloud Foundry credentials.

1. Use the `cf create-service` command to create a service instance, which we will call Cluster B.
In the `cf create-service` command, use the `-c` option with the argument `"tls" : true` to enable TLS.
This example also uses the `-c` option to set the `distributed_system_id` of Cluster B to "2":

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf create-service p-cloudcache wan-cluster wan2 -c '{
    "tls" : true,
    "distributed_system_id" : 2 }'
    </pre>

    Verify the completion of service creation prior to continuing
    to the next step.
    Output from the `cf services` command will show the `last operation` as
    `create succeeded` when service creation is completed.

## <a id="wan-create-keys"></a>Create Service Keys

1. While logged in to Foundation A, create a service key for Cluster A.
   The contents of the service key differ based upon the cluster configuration, such as
   whether an authentication and enterprise single sign-on (SSO) system such as LDAP has been configured.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf create-service-key wan1 k1
    Creating service key wan1 for service instance k1 ...
    OK
    </pre>

    The service key contains generated credentials, in a JSON element called `remote_cluster_info`, that 
    enable other clusters (Cluster B in this example) to communicate with Cluster A:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf service-key wan1 k1
    Getting key k1 for service instance wan1 ...

    {
     "distributed_system_id": "1",

1. While logged in to Foundation B, create a service key for Cluster B:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf create-service-key wan2 k2
    Creating service key wan2 for service instance k2 ...
    OK
    </pre>

    As above, the service key contains generated credentials, in a JSON element called `remote_cluster_info`, that

## <a id="wan-bi-tls-establish-bidirectional-connection"></a>Establish a Bidirectional Connection

To establish bidirectional communication between Clusters A and B, The `remote_clusters` element in
each must be updated with the contents of the other's `remote_cluster_info`, which contains three
elements:

- The `recursors` array and the `remote_locators` array enable communication between clusters.
- The `trusted_sender_credentials` element identifies a cluster from which data can be accepted for
  replication. For example, when Cluster B has been updated with Cluster A's `trusted_sender_credentials`, then Cluster B can accept and store data sent from Cluster A.

In order to implement a bidirectional WAN connection between two clusters, each must have the `trusted_sender_credentials` of the other.

1. While logged in to Foundation A, update the Cluster A service instance, using the `-c` option to specify a `remote_clusters` element that
   includes the contents of the Cluster B service key `remote_cluster_info` element, including the `recursors` array, `remote_locators` array,
   and `trusted_sender_credentials`. This allows Cluster A to communicate with Cluster B, and to accept data from Cluster B:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf update-service wan1 -c '
    {
      "remote_clusters":[
      {
        "recursors": {
         "services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh": [
          "10.1.16.7:1053",
          "10.1.16.6:1053",
          "10.1.16.8:1053"
         ]
        },
        "remote_locators": [
         "id1.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]",
         "id2.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]",
         "id3.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]"
        ],
        "trusted_sender_credentials": [
         {
          "password": "gws-PQR-password",
          "username": "gateway_sender_PQR"
         }
        ]
       }
      }
     ]
    }'
    Updating service instance wan1 as admin
    </pre>

    Verify the completion of the service update prior to continuing to the next step.
    Output from the `cf services` command will show the `last operation` as
    `update succeeded` when service update is completed.

1. While logged in to Foundation B, update the Cluster B service instance, using the `-c` option to specify a `remote_clusters` element that
   includes the contents of the Cluster A service key `remote_cluster_info` element, including the `recursors` array, `remote_locators` array,
   and `trusted_sender_credentials`. This allows Cluster B to communicate with Cluster A, and to accept data from Cluster A:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf update-service wan2 -c '
    {
      "remote_clusters":[
      {
        "recursors": {
          "services-subnet.service-instance-id.bosh": [
            "10.0.8.5:1053",
            "10.0.8.7:1053",
            "10.0.8.6:1053"
          ]
        }
        "remote_locators":[
          "id1.locator.services-subnet.service-instance-id.bosh[55221]",
          "id2.locator.services-subnet.service-instance-id.bosh[55221]",
          "id3.locator.services-subnet.service-instance-id.bosh[55221]"
        "trusted_sender_credentials":[
        {
          "username": "gateway_sender_GHI",
          "password":"gws-GHI-password"
        }]
      }]
    }'
    Updating service instance wan2 as admin
    </pre>

    Verify the completion of the service update prior to continuing to the next step.
    Output from the `cf services` command will show the `last operation` as
    `update succeeded` when service update is completed.

1. To verify that a service instance has been correctly updated, delete and recreate the cluster service key.
   The recreated service key will have the same user identifiers and passwords as its predecessor, and will reflect the changes you
   specified in the recent `cf update-service` commands.
   In particular, the `wan{}` element at the end of a cluster's service key should be populated with the other cluster's remote connection information.
   For example, to verify that the Cluster A service key was updated correctly, log in as Cluster A administrator and issue these commands to delete and
   recreate the Cluster A service key:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf delete-service-key wan1 k1
      ...
    $ cf create-service-key wan1 k1
    </pre>

    Verify that the `wan{}` field of the Cluster A service key contains a `remote_clusters`
    element which specifies contact information for Cluster B, including Cluster B's 
    `remote_locators` array and `trusted_sender_credentials`:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf service-key wan1 k1

## <a id="wan-bi-tls-create-regions"></a>Create Gateway Senders and Regions

On each cluster, create a gateway sender that sends to the other cluster, then create regions on each cluster that have the same name and type.
Note: the gateway sender must be created before the region that uses it, so there is a window of time in which region operations
that occur after the region is created on Cluster A, but before the corresponding region is created on Cluster B, will be lost.

1. While logged in to Foundation A, use gfsh to create the Cluster A gateway sender and the region.
    - Connect using gfsh following the instructions in
    [Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
    with a role that is able to manage both the cluster and the data.
    - Create the Cluster A gateway sender.
    The required `remote-distributed-system-id` option identifies the `distributed-system-id` of the destination cluster. It is 2 for this example:

        <pre class='terminal'>
        gfsh>create gateway-sender --id=send_to_2 --remote-distributed-system-id=2 --enable-persistence=true
        </pre>
    - Create the Cluster A region.
    The `gateway-sender-id` associates region operations with a specific
    gateway sender.  The region must have an associated gateway sender in
    order to propagate region events across the WAN.

        <pre class='terminal'>
        gfsh>create region --name=regionX --gateway-sender-id=send_to_2 --type=PARTITION_REDUNDANT
        </pre>

1. While logged in to Foundation B, use gfsh to create the Cluster B gateway sender and region.
    - Connect using gfsh following the instructions in
    [Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
    with a role that is able to manage both the cluster and the data.
    - Create the Cluster B gateway sender:

        <pre class='terminal'>
        gfsh>create gateway-sender --id=send_to_1 --remote-distributed-system-id=1 --enable-persistence=true
        </pre>
    - Create the Cluster B region:

        <pre class='terminal'>
        gfsh>create region --name=regionX --gateway-sender-id=send_to_1 --type=PARTITION_REDUNDANT
        </pre>

## <a id=wan-bi-tls-verify class="no_quick_link"></a>Verify Bidirectional WAN Setup

This verification uses gfsh to put a region entry into each of Cluster A
and Cluster B, in order to observe that the entry appears in the
other cluster.

1. While logged in to Foundation A, run gfsh and connect following the instructions in
[Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
with a role that is able to manage both the cluster and the data.

1. Verify that Cluster A has a complete set of gateway senders and
gateway receivers:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    gfsh>list gateways
    </pre>
    
    Also verify that there are no queued events in the gateway senders.
    
1. Log in to Foundation B in a separate terminal window, then
run gfsh and connect following the instructions in
[Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https)
with a role that is able to manage both the cluster and the data.

1. Verify that Cluster B has a complete set of gateway senders and
gateway receivers:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    gfsh>list gateways
    </pre>

    Also verify that there are no queued events in the gateway senders.
    
1. From the Cluster A gfsh connection, use gfsh to perform a `put` operation.
This example assumes that both the key and the value for the entry
are strings.
The gfsh `help put` command shows the put command's options. 
Here is an example:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    gfsh>put --region=regionX --key=mykey1 --value=stringvalue1
    Result      : true
    Key Class   : java.lang.String
    Key         : mykey1
    Value Class : java.lang.String
    Old Value   : null
    </pre>

1. Wait approximately 30 seconds, then use the Cluster B gfsh
connection to perform a `get` of the same key that was put into the region
on Cluster A.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    gfsh>get --region=regionX --key=mykey1
    Result      : true
    Key Class   : java.lang.String
    Key         : mykey1
    Value Class : java.lang.String
    Value       : "stringvalue1"
    </pre>

    You should see that Cluster B has the value.

1. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to perform a `put` operation on Cluster B
and verify that the entry is sent to Cluster A.

1. Remove both test entries from both clusters with two gfsh
commands, issuing the commands on one of the clusters.
WAN replication will cause the removal of the test entries
on the other cluster.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    gfsh>remove --region=regionX --key=mykey1
    Result    : true
    Key Class : java.lang.String
    Key       : mykey1

    gfsh>remove --region=regionX --key=mykey2
    Result    : true
    Key Class : java.lang.String
    Key       : mykey2
    </pre>
