## <a id='v12-known-issues'></a>Known Issues

- If you are running apps that use Spring Session Data GemFire 2.0.0.M1 and you upgrade from PCC v1.1.x to v1.2, those apps experience downtime during the upgrade. Developers must upgrade to Spring Session Data GemFire 2.0.0.M2 and redeploy those apps to run on PCC v1.2. For details, see [Upgrade Spring Session Data Gemfire](./developer.html#spring_session_data_gemfire) in the PCC v1.2 Developer Guide.

- Current versions of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI) tool
have a known bug that omits the documentation URL when
using the `cf service` command.
