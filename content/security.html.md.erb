The security measures implemented for a PCF foundation and
for PCC service instances within that foundation attempt to
reduce harm from agents with foundation access.
See [Understanding Cloud Foundry Security](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/security.html)
for a general presentation on PCF security.
TLS encryption prevents easy access to communication between
components,
and role-based authentication and authorization limits access
to data.

### TLS Encryption for the PCC Service Instance

Without TLS encryption with and within the PCC service instance,
the diagram identifies plaintext communication that could be
listened to by a bad agent with PCF foundation access.
The unencrypted communications are shown with green dotted and dashed
line segments.

Each of these unencrypted communication paths may be TLS-encrypted.
The encrypted communications are shown with red dashed line segments
in the diagram.
To encrypt these communications,
follow the directions given in [Migrating to a TLS-Enabled Cluster](migrate-to-TLS.html),
and ensure that apps also use TLS as described in
[Developing an App Under TLS](tls-enabled-app.html).
Enabling TLS encryption implements a 1-way authentication of
apps verifying the identity of GemFire cluster members.

Gfsh communication must also be secured.
Follow directions within
[Connect with gfsh over HTTPS](accessing-instance.html#gfsh-connect-https).

### Networking

Create application security groups 
to allow app access to the PCC network.
Allow access on the following ports:

* 1099
* 8080
* 40404
* 55221

For more information, see the PCF [Application Security Groups](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html#creating-groups) topic.

PCC works with the IPsec Add-on for PCF.
For information about the IPsec Add-on for PCF,
see [Securing Data in Transit with the IPsec Add-on](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/index.html).

### Security within the GemFire Cluster 

The GemFire cluster within a PCC service instance implements
role-based authentication
and authorizes cluster operations based upon the roles. 

There are two sets of roles.
Which set is used for a PCC service instance depends on the
options chosen during PCC tile installation.

All gfsh and JMX clients must authenticate as
one of these user roles to access the cluster.
To authorize operations,
each user role is given predefined permissions for cluster operations.
To accomplish a cluster operation,
the user authenticates using one of the roles.
Prior to initiating the requested operation,
there is a verification that the
authenticated user role has the permission authorized to do the operation.
More details about these permissions are in the Pivotal GemFire documentation
under [Implementing Authorization](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/geode/managing/security/implementing_authorization.html).

- One set has four roles for users that integrate 
an authentication and enterprise single sign-on (SSO)
system such as LDAP.
See [Configuring UAA Roles](UAA-config.html) for a description of
the roles and the configuration that completes the integration.

- The other set of roles defaults when there is no 
authentication and enterprise single sign-on (SSO) system such as LDAP
integrated during the PCC tile installation.
The identifiers assigned for these roles are detailed in
[Create Service Keys](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key).
PCC service instances are created with three default GemFire user roles for
interacting with clusters:

    - A cluster operator manages the GemFire cluster and can access
    region data. The  cluster operator role has 
    `CLUSTER:MANAGE`,
    `CLUSTER:WRITE`,
    `CLUSTER:READ`,
    `DATA:MANAGE`,
    `DATA:WRITE`,
     and `DATA:READ` permissions.
    - A developer can access region data. The developer role has
    `CLUSTER:READ`,
    `DATA:WRITE`,
    and `DATA:READ` permissions.
    - A gateway sender propagates region data to another PCC service instance.
    The gateway sender role has `DATA:WRITE` permission.
