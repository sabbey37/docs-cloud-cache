title: Using a Service Gateway
---

The service gateway allows apps that run in a different location than
the Services Foundation where the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance runs
to communicate with the service instance.
At its core, the service gateway is a TCP router.

There are three locations where an app may run.
The locations are defined in
[The App's Location](architecture.html#AppLocation).

Apps that run within an App Foundation and apps that run completely outside of
any foundation must have a service gateway enabled and running
to communicate with the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
To enable and run the service instance:

- The operator must
[Configure a Service Gateway](configure-service-gateway.html).
- The developer must [Provide Optional Parameters](create-instance.html#params)
when creating the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
- The app must be given and use properties that authenticate
and authorize [Communicating with a Service Instance](running-app.html#app-location) through the service gateway.

If traffic through the service gateway becomes a performance bottleneck,
the service gateway may be scaled.

1. Discover if the service gateway is a bottleneck by 
first using the BOSH CLI to log in and target your services foundation.

2. Find your `BROKER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` by running the command:

    ```
    bosh deployments | grep "^p-cloudcache"
    ```

    The first column of the output is the `BROKER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME`.

3. Use the `BROKER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME` in the command:

    ```
    bosh -d BROKER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME vms --vitals
    ```

If the CPU usage in the sni-tcp-router VM is high,
you can scale the service gateway by altering the <%=vars.product_short%>
tile.

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard,
click on the <%=vars.product_short%> tile.
2. Within the tile **Settings**, click on **Resource Config**.
3. Increase the quantity of **TCP Router INSTANCES**.
4. Click **SAVE**.
5. Review and apply the changes.
