title: Restoring a WAN Connection
---

This sequence of steps restores a bidirectional WAN connection to a service instance
when the service instance has been restored from backup.

In this description, cluster A is an existing, running service instance that was formerly connected to cluster B over a WAN connection,
and cluster B is the service that has been freshly restored from backup, and needs to be reconnected.

At this point in the process, cluster B should have the following characteristics:

- All data restored from backup
- The same `distributed_system_id` as its predecessor
- A freshly-generated service key

If the restored `distributed_system_id` matches that in the backup, then there is no need to recreate
gateway senders and receivers; they are already defined. This procedure manually updates gateway senders with
pointers to remote locators and credentials, re-enabling their ability to connect across the WAN
without authentication errors.

1. Obtain the service key for cluster A.
  The service key contains generated credentials, in a JSON element called `remote_cluster_info`, that 
  enable other clusters (Cluster B in this example) to communicate with Cluster A:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf service-key A k1
    </pre>

    The contents of the service key differ based upon the cluster configuration, such as whether an external authentication such as LDAP via User Account and Authentication (UAA) has been configured.
    Here is sample output from `cf service-key A k1`:

      },

       "id2.locator.services-subnet.service-instance-id.bosh[55221]",

      ],
      "trusted_sender_credentials": [
       {

    }
    </pre>

1. Obtain the service key of cluster B:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf service-key B k2
    </pre>

    As above, the service key contains generated credentials, in a JSON element called `remote_cluster_info`, that
    enable other clusters (Cluster A in this example) to communicate with Cluster B. Here is sample output
    from `cf service-key B k2`:

       "id3.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]"
      ],
      "trusted_sender_credentials": [
       {
        "password": "gws-PQR-password",
        "username": "gateway_sender_PQR"
       }
      ]
     },
     "urls": {
      "gfsh": "https://cloudcache-2.example.com/gemfire/v1",
      "pulse": "https://cloudcache-2.example.com/pulse"
     },
     "users": [
      {
       "password": "cl-op-JKL-password",
       "roles": [

       ],
       "username": "cluster_operator_JKL"
      },
      {
       "password": "dev-MNO-password",
       "roles": [
        "developer"
       ],
       "username": "developer_MNO"
      }
     ],
     "wan": {}
    }
    </pre>

1. Update the Cluster A service instance, using the `-c` option to specify a `remote_clusters` element that
   includes the contents of the Cluster B service key `remote_cluster_info` element, including the `recursors` array, `remote_locators` array,
   and `trusted_sender_credentials`. This allows Cluster A to communicate with Cluster B, and to accept data from Cluster B:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf update-service A -c '
    {
      "remote_clusters":[
      {
        "recursors": {
         "services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh": [
          "10.1.16.7:1053",
          "10.1.16.6:1053",
          "10.1.16.8:1053"
         ]
        },
        "remote_locators": [
         "id1.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]",
         "id2.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]",
         "id3.locator.services-subnet-2.service-instance-id-2.bosh[55221]"
        ],
        "trusted_sender_credentials": [
         {
          "password": "gws-PQR-password",
          "username": "gateway_sender_PQR"
         }
        ]
       }
      }
     ]
    }'
    Updating service instance A as admin
    </pre>

1. To verify that a service instance has been correctly updated, delete and recreate the cluster service key.
   The recreated service key will have the same user identifiers and passwords as its predecessor, and will reflect the changes you
   specified in the recent `cf update-service` commands.
   In particular, the `wan{}` element at the end of a cluster's service key should be populated with the other cluster's remote connection information.
   For example, to verify that the Cluster A service key was updated correctly, log in as Cluster A administrator and issue these commands to delete and
   recreate the Cluster A service key:

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cf delete-service-key A k1
      ...
    $ cf create-service-key A k1
    </pre>

    Verify that the `wan{}` field of the Cluster A service key contains a `remote_clusters`
    element which specifies contact information for Cluster B, including Cluster B's `recursors` array,
    `remote_locators` array, and `trusted_sender_credentials`:
