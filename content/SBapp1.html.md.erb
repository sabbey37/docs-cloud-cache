title: An Example Spring Boot App
---
<a id="sample-SB1"></a>

The versioned example Spring Boot Data GemFire app at
[PCC-Sample-App-PizzaStore](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/PCC-Sample-App-PizzaStore)
uses the <%=vars.component_product%> cluster within a <%=vars.product_full%> service instance as a system of record.
Directions for running the app are in the GitHub repository's `README.md` file.
The app is versioned, and branches of the repository represent <%=vars.product_short%>
versions.
For <%=vars.product_short%> <%=vars.product_version%>, use the branch named
`release/<%=vars.product_version_period%>`.

The app uses Spring Boot Data GemFire. The documentation for this opinionated extension of Spring Data GemFire is at [Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire Reference Guide](https://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-boot-data-geode-build/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/).

The app saves pizza orders within the <%=vars.component_product%> servers of a <%=vars.product_short%> service
instance.
The app takes orders for pizza toppings and sauces with a REST interface.

In addition, the app demonstrates two distinct features of <%=vars.product_short%>:

- Running an app on a TLS-enabled cluster within <%=vars.product_short%>.
- <%=vars.component_product%> continuous queries as used by a Spring Boot app.

## Top Down Explanation

In this opinionated version of Spring Boot Data GemFire,
at the topmost level of the app,
the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation causes
the app to have a `ClientCache` instance.
Within the example app's `CloudcachePizzaStoreApplication` class,
the annotation belongs on the class header:

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class CloudcachePizzaStoreApplication
```
This app is the client within a standard client/server architecture.
The <%=vars.product_short%> cluster contains the servers.
The client cache is a driver for interactions with the servers,
allowing eventual region creation within the client cache.

Annotate the configuration with `@EnableEntityDefinedRegions` to enable
a runtime scan of classes that define the <%=vars.component_product%> regions. 
Within `GemFireConfiguration.java` in this example:

```
@EnableEntityDefinedRegions(basePackageClasses = Pizza.class)
public class GemFireConfiguration
```
The Spring repository construct is the correct choice to use
for the data storage, which will be a <%=vars.component_product%> region.
To implement it,
annotate this example's `PizzaRepository` implementation
with `@Repository`:

```
@Repository
public interface PizzaRepository extends CrudRepository<Pizza, String>
```

A <%=vars.component_product%> region underlies the Spring repository,
storing the ordered pizzas.
Annotate the `Pizza` class model with `@Region`:

```
@Region("Pizza")
public class Pizza {
```

Within the `Pizza` class, identify the key of the <%=vars.component_product%> region entries with
the `@Id` annotation.
It is the `name` field in this example:

```
@Getter @Id @NonNull
private final String name;
```

The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation 
results in a chain of opinionated defaults,
all of which are appropriate for this app.
It identifies the app as a client.
The client receives a <%=vars.component_product%> client cache.
Any regions will default to type `PROXY`.
A proxy type of region forwards all region operations to the
Gemfire servers; no data is stored within the app's client cache.

See [Configuring Regions](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data-gemfire/docs/current/reference/html/#bootstrap-annotation-config-regions) for Spring details.
See [Region Design](region-design.html) for <%=vars.product_short%> details on regions.

## The App Contoller

The `AppController` class implements the REST interface,
by annotating the class with `@RestController`:

```
@RestController
public class AppController
```
As pizzas are ordered,
a `CrudRepository.save()` operation causes a
<%=vars.component_product%> `put` operation that updates the region on the <%=vars.component_product%> server.

## TLS-Enabled Cluster Demonstration

The app operates in one of two ways:

1. Communication with and within the <%=vars.component_product%> cluster uses
TLS encryption.
1. Communication with and within the <%=vars.component_product%> cluster _does not_ use
TLS encryption.

The operation of the running app is unchanged
whether TLS encryption is enabled within the Gemfire cluster or not.

Setting up this app with TLS encryption enabled
demonstrates one way to set the needed <%=vars.component_product%> properties
detailed in [Developing an App Under TLS](tls-enabled-app.html).
It uses Spring profiles.
The manifest that sets the `tls` profile incorporates the <%=vars.component_product%>
properties from file `/resources/application-tls.properties`.

## Continuous Queries in the App

The app defines two continuous queries (CQ).
See [Handling Events](events.html) for a brief introduction to
continuous queries.

The first CQ queries for any (and every) pizza order.
Its callback logs the order.

The second CQ queries for pizzas with a `PESTO` sauce.
When a pesto-sauced pizza is ordered,
the callback adds that pizza to a second region called `Name`.

Within a Spring Boot Data GemFire app,
to specify a continuous query:

- annotate the class that defines the queries with `@Component`:

    ```
    @Component
    public class PizzaQueries
    ```
- annotate the callback method with `@ContinuousQuery` and define
the query, as in the app's pesto pizza order example:

    ```
    @ContinuousQuery(name = "PestoPizzaOrdersQuery", durable = true,
        query = "SELECT * FROM /Pizza p WHERE p.sauce.name = 'PESTO'")
    public void handlePestoPizzaOrder(CqEvent event)
    ```
    The annotation causes an implementation of all three needed items
    for this type of event handling. It defines the query,
    registers the query as a continuous query event,
    and it identifies the callback method to invoke when the event occurs.
