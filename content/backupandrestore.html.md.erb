title: Backing Up and Restoring Service Instances
---

<a id="BandR"></a>

Both disaster recovery and system validation depend upon
backups.
A <%=vars.product_full%> service instance backup consists of the configuration for a 
<%=vars.product_short%> service instance together with all region data that has been
persisted to disk.
A <%=vars.product_short%> service instance backup may be used to restore the service
on a new, but unconfigured <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.

# Before You Begin

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Consider each of these 
important items when preparing to back up and restore a <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
Since recovery depends on a correct implemention, 
address each item during planning.</p>

- The backup consists of data from regions that have
been persisted to disk.
All non-persistent region data will be lost. 
A persistent region is one that writes its region entries to disk.
- The backup and restoration process does not restore WAN replication
configuration. A <%=vars.product_short%> service instance that replicates data via WAN
may be backed up. A restore of that <%=vars.product_short%> service instance will
contain all the persistent data. That <%=vars.product_short%> service instance will 
be able to communicate with other WAN-connected service instances after further configuration.
- The disk size on the jumpbox VM must be large enough to hold the
backup artifacts. The quantity of disk space needs to exceed
the sum total of all disk space used within the <%=vars.product_short%> service instance to be
backed up.
An approximation of that quantity of disk space may be calculated
by looking at the fully populated <%=vars.product_short%> service instance.
Sum the disk space (in `/var/vcap/store`) used by each locator and server.
- The <%=vars.product_short%> service instance needs to be quiescent when the backup is
taken. An active cluster could have disk writes in progress,
leading to a backup for which region data may or may not have been
written to disk. 
- The fresh <%=vars.product_short%> service instance that is to be used for a restore
must have same quantity of locators and servers as the
<%=vars.product_short%> service instance had when its backup was taken.
The fresh <%=vars.product_short%> service instance must have sufficient resources
to hold the data that is in the backup.
- Do not configure the fresh <%=vars.product_short%> service instance
that is to be used for a restore after creation.
It must be empty. Do not create any regions or start any gateway senders.
The restore will create all regions, both persistent and not persistent.
The non-persistent regions will be empty.
- Service keys are not part of the backup. Service keys will need to be
created anew on a restored service instance.

# Backing Up a <%=vars.product_short%> Service Instance

1. Optional: Back up the <%=vars.app_runtime_full%> environment.
For instructions, see [Backing Up Pivotal Platform with BBR](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).

2. Optional: Compact the disk stores of the cluster to be backed up.
Use the gfsh `compact disk-store` command after connecting to the cluster
with a role that is authorized with the `CLUSTER:MANAGE` operation permission.
See the documentation for gfsh
[`compact disk-store`](http://gemfire.docs.pivotal.io/<%=vars.gemfire_minor_nodot%>/geode/tools_modules/gfsh/command-pages/compact.html#topic_F113C95C076F424E9AA8AC4F1F6324CC).

3. Optional: Acquire a region statistic that may be used for a minimal
validation upon using this backup for subsequent restoration.
Use the gfsh `describe region` command on each persistent region,
after connecting to the cluster
with a role that is authorized with the `CLUSTER:READ` operation permission.
    
    ```
    describe region --name=REGION-NAME
    ```
    For each persistent region (the `data-policy` will contain the string
    `PERSISTENT`), record the `size` of region. This size is the quantity
    of entries in the region. Assuming that activity on
    the region is quiescent, when this backup is used in a restoration,
    the quantity of region entries in the restored region forms a 
    minimal validation of the region. 

4. Ssh to the jumpbox.
Assuming that the <%=vars.ops_manager%> VM is being used as the jumpbox,
follow directions at
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

5. Determine all needed credentials and parameters for the 
command that makes the backup: 
    - `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP`: Obtain the BOSH Director IP address by following the instructions at [Step 4:Retrieve BOSH Director Address](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html#retrieve-address).
    -  `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: Obtain the deployment name by following the instructions at [Acquire the Deployment Name](troubleshooting.html#get-deployment-name).
    -  `BOSH-CLIENT`, `BOSH-CLIENT-PASSWORD`, and `PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE`: To learn all three of these values, open the Credentials tab of the BOSH Director tile in <%=vars.ops_manager%>. Find and open `Bosh Commandline Credentials`.
The path is the path to the root Certificate Authority (CA) certificate,
and its value will be `/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate` if <%=vars.ops_manager%> and the jumpbox are on the same VM.

6. Make the backup. From the jumpbox, issue this command,
substituting values acquired in the previous step:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-PASSWORD \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    --deployment SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    backup
    ```

    `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` is an environment variable that is set only
    for the duration of the command.

    The backup will be within a directory on the jumpbox named by
    the depoyment name and a timestamp.

7. Copy the backup to a permanent home for archiving.
VMware recommends compressing and encrypting the files.
Disaster recovery plans often recommend archiving multiple copies
of each backup.

# Restoring a <%=vars.product_short%> Service Instance

1. Use SSH to connect to the jumpbox.
Assuming that the <%=vars.ops_manager%> VM is being used as the jumpbox,
follow directions at
[Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).
 
2. Transfer the archived backup to the jumpbox.
Expand if compressed, and decrypt if encrypted.

3. Make a new, but empty service instance.
See directions in [Creating a <%=vars.product_full%> Service Instance](create-instance.html).
If the service instance to be restored was connected to a WAN, be sure to create the new instance with the same `distributed_system_id` as
the old one.

4. Determine all needed credentials and parameters for the 
command that does the restore by following step 5 instructions
from making the backup. 

5. Do the restore. From the jumpbox, issue this command,
substituting values acquired in the previous step:

    ```
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=BOSH-CLIENT-PASSWORD \
    bbr deployment \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username BOSH-CLIENT \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERTIFICATE \
    --deployment SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    restore --artifact-path PATH-TO-SERVICE-INSTANCE-ARTIFACT
    ```

    `PATH-TO-SERVICE-INSTANCE-ARTIFACT` is the path to the artifact for the instance that you are currently restoring.

6. Create a new service key, as the service key was not an artifact 
that the backup created. 
For a stand-alone service instance (one that is not part of a WAN), follow the directions at [Create a Service Key](accessing-instance.html#create-service-key).
For a WAN-connected service instance, see [Restoring a WAN Connection](WAN-bi-reconnect.html).

7. If the region size was captured prior to making the
backup, in order to do a minimal validation
of the restored cluster,
use the gfsh `describe region` command on each persistent region,
after connecting to the cluster
with a role that is authorized with the `CLUSTER:READ` operation permission.
    
    ```
    describe region --name=REGION-NAME
    ```
    For each persistent region, the `size` of the restored region should be
    the same as the value captured when the backup was made.

8. Rebind or restage all apps.
